    Angular has just been introduced to my development team at work as a new
    technology for our front end client apps, so thought I'd re-write this app
    in Angular (I'd written a React version of it about a month ago as have just
    started to learn React)
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    The app fetches data from a C# Web-API I've written that reads from an Azure
    database, and is also deployed to Azure itself.
